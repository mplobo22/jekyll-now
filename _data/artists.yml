  bio: "Born Elena Pisetski in 1970 in the Russian city of Ekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains, Herzog moved to St. Petersburg in 1987 to attend the Philological Faculty of St. Petersburg University where she studied languages (English & Spanish) and literature. In 1990 she emigrated to the United States and graduated with a degree in Philosophy from Mills College specializing in the History and Philosophy of Science. She was also a research consultant at Stanford University. Herzog started taking photographs in 1997 and studied photographic printing techniques with the Italian master printer Ivan Dalla Tana in Milan and later with French master printer Marc Valesella. She combines some of the very early photographic darkroom processes with contemporary techniques to achieve her desired effects.

  She lives in Los Angeles with her husband, German filmmaker Werner Herzog. They have collaborated on some projects including a book of stills from her husband’s film Bad Lieutenant which was published by Rizzoli in 2009. Werner Herzog wrote the introduction to Lena Herzog’s book Pilgrims, which was released in 2002."
hopper_edward:
  name: "Edward Hopper"
  dates: "July 22, 1882 – May 15, 1967"
  movement: "American Genre Painting/Realism"
  website: "http://www.moma.org/collection/works/79616"
  bio: "Edward Hopper was a prominent American realist painter and printmaker. While he was most popularly known for his oil paintings, he was equally proficient as a watercolorist and printmaker in etching. Both in his urban and rural scenes, his spare and finely calculated renderings reflected his personal vision of modern American life.

  In 1905, Hopper landed a part-time job with an advertising agency, where he created cover designs for trade magazines.Hopper came to detest illustration. He was bound to it by economic necessity until the mid-1920s. He temporarily escaped by making three trips to Europe, each centered in Paris, ostensibly to study the emerging art scene there. In fact, however, he studied alone and seemed mostly unaffected by the new currents in art. Later he said that he 'didn't remember having heard of Picasso at all.' He was highly impressed by Rembrandt, particularly his Night Watch, which he said was 'the most wonderful thing of his I have seen; it's past belief in its reality.'

  Hopper began painting urban and architectural scenes in a dark palette. Then he shifted to the lighter palette of the Impressionists before returning to the darker palette with which he was comfortable. Hopper later said, 'I got over that and later things done in Paris were more the kind of things I do now.' Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and café scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract cubist experiments, Hopper was attracted to realist art. Later, he admitted to no European influences other than French engraver Charles Méryon, whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated."
